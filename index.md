Hi! 😊 I’m **Ming Chen**, a PhD student at the School of Education, University of Bristol.  
You can also find me on my [University profile page](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/ming-chen).

My doctoral research investigates how **Virtual Reality Digital Content Creation (VRDCC)** can enhance **learner engagement** and **vocabulary development** in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classrooms. My broader interests lie in the intersection of learning sciences, applied linguistics, and educational technologies.
