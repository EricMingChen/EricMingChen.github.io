Hi! ðŸ˜Š Iâ€™m Ming Chen, a PhD student at the School of Education, University of Bristol. You can also find me on my [University profile page](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/ming-chen).

My doctoral research explores how virtual reality digital content creation (VRDCC) can enhance learner engagement and vocabulary development in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classrooms. 

More broadly, I explore the intersections of learning sciences, applied linguistics, and educational technologies such as VR and AI.
