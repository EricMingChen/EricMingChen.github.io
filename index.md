Hi! ðŸ˜Š Iâ€™m Ming Chen, a PhD student at the School of Education, University of Bristol. You can also find me on my [University profile page](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/ming-chen).

My doctoral research explores how virtual reality digital content creation (VRDCC) can enhance learner engagement and vocabulary development in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classrooms. 

More broadly, I am interested in how emerging technologies, especially Virtual Reality (VR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), can be thoughtfully integrated into language learning and teaching. My work focuses on technology-enhanced language learning and innovative pedagogical designs that support learner-centered and engaging experiences.
