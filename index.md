Hi! ðŸ˜Š Iâ€™m Ming Chen, a fully funded PhD student at the School of Education, University of Bristol.  
You can also find me on my [University profile page](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/ming-chen).

My doctoral research investigates how Virtual Reality Digital Content Creation (VRDCC) can enhance learner engagement and vocabulary development in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classrooms. My broader research interests lie in Computer-Assisted Language Learning, focusing on the intersection of learning sciences, applied linguistics, and educational technologies.
